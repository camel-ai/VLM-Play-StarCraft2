## About CAMEL-AI.org

We are proud to be part of üê´ CAMEL-AI.org, the pioneer of large language model-based multi-agent frameworks. CAMEL-AI.org is inspired by the research paper "CAMEL: Communicative Agents for 'Mind' Exploration of Large Language Model Society," and aims to explore scalable techniques for autonomous cooperation among communicative agents and their cognitive processes.

This project aligns with CAMEL's mission by:
- Implementing a novel multi-agent system in the StarCraft II environment
- Exploring agent cooperation and decision-making through multimodal interactions
- Contributing to the advancement of practical AI applications

## Overview

This project develops a multimodal agent for StarCraft II that processes both visual information and text descriptions to make strategic decisions. The agent leverages vision-language models and reinforcement learning techniques to understand and interact with the game environment.

## Key Features

- üéÆ Custom environment based on OpenAI Gym
- üñºÔ∏è Support for multimodal inputs (images and text)
- ü§ñ Automatic unit annotation system
- üéØ Multiple agent types (Random, VLM, Test agents)
- üó∫Ô∏è Rich map selection for different scenarios
- üõ†Ô∏è Support for both ability and non-ability based gameplay
- ü§ù Support for both single-player and two-player modes

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- Windows 11 (primary support)
- StarCraft II (Asia Battle.net version)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
```

2. Install in editable mode:
```bash
pip install -e . --no-deps
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r vlm_attention/requirements.txt
```

4. Fix potential protobuf conflicts:
```bash
pip uninstall protobuf
pip install protobuf==3.20.0
pip install pysc2 --no-deps
```

### Running the Project

1. Single Player (No Abilities):
```bash
python vlm_attention/run_env/multiprocess_run_env.py --agent VLMAgentWithoutMove --map vlm_attention_1
```

2. Two Players (No Abilities):
```bash
python vlm_attention/run_env/multiprocess_run_env_two_players.py --agent1 TestAgent --agent2 VLMAgent
```

3. Single Player (With Abilities):
```bash
python vlm_attention/run_env/multiprocess_run_env_with_ability.py --agent VLMAgentWithAbility
```

4. Two Players (With Abilities):
```bash
python vlm_attention/run_env/multi_process_run_env_two_players_with_ability.py --agent1 TestAgent --agent2 VLMAgent
```

## Available Maps

### Single Player Maps
- Basic maps (vlm_attention_1, 2m_vs_1z, etc.)
- Complex scenarios (2c_vs_64zg, 8marine_2tank_vs_zerglings_banelings, etc.)
- Mirror matches (2s3z, 3m)

### Two Player Maps
- Balanced matchups (MMM_vlm_attention_two_players)
- Asymmetric battles (vlm_attention_1_two_players)
- Mirror matches (vlm_attention_2_terran_vs_terran_two_players)
